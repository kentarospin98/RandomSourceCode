# RandomSourceCode
-What are our project is:
  This project is basically about a simple board game,which we devised for time pass in free period. 

-How to use it:
  It is a simple board game you can play in online using random integer function. You should know some rules before play,
 1. You have to choose length of one side of the board(the number of small box which players will place)
  *Recommanded length for each player:
   2- 4*4 3-5*5 4-7*7 
 2. You can input name of players and choose symbols which you will play as(Min 2 people Max 4 people and 8 symbols are available)
 3. After setting up everything, One random function will be chosen when you play ; Move,Shoot,Build,Break and Jump.
 4. Each function has different ability:
    >Move : You can move 1~2 in horizontally, vertically and even diagonally. But you can't move across the wall. If you move on another              player, you can push him to one step to any direction. Even you can push him into the wall!
    >Shoot: You can shoot the others once in movable place, or in straight line. But you can't shoot when others are behind the wall. When            you shoot, the enemy gets one life reduced and returned to spawned place. When the life gets over, you are out.
    >Build: You can build a wall in every eight direction one step away from your place.
    >Break: You can break a wall in every eight direction one step away from your place.
    >Jump : You can jump across the wall near you. You can jump across maximum two walls. If you jump on the others, the enemy gets one              life reduced and returned to spawned place.
 5. Who survived alone will be winner of the game!
    
-Why we made it:
  We have enjoyed random integer game during free period so that we want to share our idea through this project and makes others also can   enjoy this game.
